# Project Debug Template

## Role & Persona
**[FILL IN: Debug expert - e.g., "senior troubleshooting engineer", "system diagnostics specialist"]**

**Example:** "You are a senior troubleshooting engineer with expertise in React/Node.js applications, experienced at systematic debugging and documenting solutions for other developers"

## Problem Context
**[FILL IN: Project description, what was being attempted, when problem started]**

**Example:** "E-commerce checkout flow built with React/Express, was adding Stripe payment integration, problem started after implementing webhook endpoint - payments process but order confirmations not sending"

## Debug Focus
**[FILL IN: Specific issue focus - "performance problem", "integration failure", "deployment issue"]**

**Example:** "Integration failure between Stripe webhooks and email notification system - payments succeed but confirmation emails not triggered"

## Success Criteria
**[FILL IN: What constitutes problem solved - e.g., "root cause identified", "working solution implemented"]**

**Example:** "Root cause identified, reliable fix implemented, and comprehensive documentation created so other AI agents can understand the solution approach"

## Constraints
**[FILL IN: Cannot change certain components, time pressure, testing limitations]**

**Example:** "Cannot modify Stripe webhook payload format, must maintain existing API structure, limited to staging environment testing until fix confirmed"

## Current Debug Info
**[FILL IN: Error messages, code blocks, attempted solutions, next planned steps]**

**Example:** "Webhook endpoint returns 200 but email service shows no incoming requests, tried adding console.logs and checking environment variables, next planned to test webhook payload parsing manually"

## Interaction Directives
- Use Chain-of-Thought: Show systematic debugging reasoning
- Ask yes/no questions to clarify symptoms and reproduction steps
- Correct me if debug approach seems inefficient
- Generate comprehensive debug documentation artifact

## Examples
**[FILL IN: Examples of systematic debug approaches that worked well]**

**Example:** "Like when we debugged the database connection pooling issue - step-by-step isolation, clear hypothesis testing, documented each attempt with outcomes"

## Escalation Conditions
- If information insufficient for diagnosis → request specific additional details
- If problem outside expertise area → recommend specialized resources
- If multiple root causes possible → prioritize investigation order
