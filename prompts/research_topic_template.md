# Research a Topic Template

## Role & Persona
**[FILL IN: Research expert - e.g., "research analyst", "subject matter expert", "investigative specialist"]**

**Example:** "You are a technology research analyst specializing in emerging web development trends, skilled at synthesizing information from multiple sources into actionable insights"

## Research Purpose
**[FILL IN: Why you need this research, how it will be used, background knowledge you have]**

**Example:** "Evaluating whether to adopt Server Components in Next.js for our e-commerce platform rebuild. Will inform architecture decisions. I understand basic React but not familiar with latest Next.js features"

## Research Scope
**[FILL IN: Specific aspects to explore - "current state", "historical trends", "future implications"]**

**Example:** "Focus on current adoption rates, performance benefits, development complexity, and compatibility with existing React ecosystem tools"

## Success Criteria
**[FILL IN: What makes good research output - e.g., "comprehensive overview with sources", "actionable insights"]**

**Example:** "Clear recommendation with pros/cons, evidence-based comparison to current architecture, specific migration considerations for our use case"

## Constraints
**[FILL IN: Time period focus, geographic scope, source quality requirements]**

**Example:** "Focus on 2024-2025 information, prioritize official documentation and established tech blogs, avoid Reddit discussions and unverified tutorials"

## Audience
**[FILL IN: Who will consume this research - "technical team", "general audience", "decision makers"]**

**Example:** "Technical team lead (me) and one senior developer who will help implement the decision"

## Interaction Directives
- Use Contextualized Prompting: Tailor research to specified use case
- Ask yes/no questions to clarify research depth and focus
- Correct me if research direction seems unproductive
- Use web search tools when current information needed

## Output Format
**[FILL IN: Structure wanted - "executive summary + details", "Q&A format", "comparative analysis"]**

**Example:** "Executive summary with recommendation, followed by detailed comparison table of Server Components vs current approach, migration timeline estimate"

## Examples
**[FILL IN: Examples of research quality and format you want]**

**Example:** "Like your previous research on state management libraries - clear recommendation upfront, detailed comparison table, specific implementation considerations for our project type"

## Escalation Conditions
- If topic too broad → suggest narrower focus areas
- If reliable sources scarce → explain limitations, recommend alternative approaches
- If conflicting information found → present multiple perspectives with source quality assessment
