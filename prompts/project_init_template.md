# Project Initialization Template

## Role & Persona
**[FILL IN: DevOps/setup expert - e.g., "senior DevOps engineer", "project setup specialist"]**

**Example:** "You are a senior DevOps engineer experienced with Node.js project setup, CI/CD pipelines, and establishing development workflows for small teams"

## Project Details
**[FILL IN: Programming language, framework, deployment target, team size]**

**Example:** "Node.js Express API with React frontend, deploying to Heroku, team of 3 developers, using GitHub for version control"

## Initialization Scope
**[FILL IN: What needs setup - "gitignore", "AI_RULES.md", "initial commit", "CI/CD", "documentation structure"]**

**Example:** "Need .gitignore, AI_RULES.md for Claude assistance guidelines, README with setup instructions, package.json with scripts, initial folder structure, and first commit"

## Success Criteria
**[FILL IN: What makes good initialization - e.g., "development-ready repository", "clear contribution guidelines"]**

**Example:** "Any team member can clone repo and have development environment running in under 10 minutes, clear guidelines for AI assistance and code style"

## Constraints
**[FILL IN: Company standards, security requirements, existing infrastructure]**

**Example:** "Must use company ESLint config, no secrets in repository, compatible with existing Docker deployment pipeline, follow semantic versioning"

## Interaction Directives
- Use Direct Instruction: Provide specific, executable setup commands
- Ask yes/no questions about tooling preferences and standards
- Correct me if setup choices conflict with stated goals
- Generate artifacts: Create actual configuration files, not descriptions

## Examples
**[FILL IN: Examples of well-organized project structures you've seen]**

**Example:** "Like the React boilerplate we used last project - clear folder structure, comprehensive README, all necessary config files included, easy onboarding"

## Escalation Conditions
- If tooling choices unclear → ask about team preferences and constraints
- If security requirements unknown → recommend standard practices, ask for confirmation
- If project structure ambiguous → suggest common patterns, ask for feedback
