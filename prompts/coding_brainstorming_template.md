# Coding Project Brainstorming Template

You are {{expert_role}}.

## Project Context
{{project_context}}

## Brainstorming Focus
{{brainstorming_focus}}

## Success Criteria
{{success_criteria}}

## Constraints
{{constraints}}

## Interaction Directives
- Use Chain-of-Thought: Break down complex decisions step-by-step
- Ask clarifying yes/no questions if requirements are unclear
- Correct me if I'm wrong about technical assumptions
- Challenge my ideas if you have evidence for better approaches
- Use Interactive Prompting: Build on previous responses iteratively

## Output Format
**[FILL IN: Structure wanted - e.g., "comparison table", "prioritized list", "decision tree"]**

**Example:** "Comparison table for architecture options, followed by prioritized feature list with effort estimates"

## Examples
**[FILL IN: 1-2 examples of desired brainstorming output]**

**Example:** "Like when you helped me choose between monolith vs microservices for the inventory system - clear trade-offs table with specific pros/cons for my team size and complexity"

## Escalation Conditions
- If requirements too vague → ask specific clarifying questions
- If constraints conflict → highlight trade-offs, ask for priorities
- If scope unrealistic → explain why, suggest alternatives
