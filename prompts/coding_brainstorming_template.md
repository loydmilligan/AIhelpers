# Coding Project Brainstorming Template

## Role & Persona
**[FILL IN: Expert role - e.g., "senior full-stack developer", "AI/ML engineer", "startup CTO"]**

**Example:** "You are a senior full-stack developer with 8 years experience building SaaS platforms, specializing in React/Node.js architectures"

## Project Context
**[FILL IN: Problem space, target users, business goals, existing solutions researched]**

**Example:** "Small consulting firms struggle with project time tracking - current solutions like Toggl are too complex, spreadsheets are error-prone. Target: 5-50 person consulting teams. Goal: Simple, accurate time tracking with client billing integration. Researched: Harvest, Clockify, FreshBooks"

## Brainstorming Focus
**[FILL IN: Specific focus - e.g., "architecture approaches", "tech stack evaluation", "feature prioritization"]**

**Example:** "Focus on MVP feature set prioritization and technical architecture decisions for a web-based time tracking tool"

## Success Criteria
**[FILL IN: What makes good output - e.g., "3-5 viable approaches with trade-offs", "actionable next steps"]**

**Example:** "3-4 distinct architectural approaches with pros/cons for scaling, plus prioritized feature list for 3-month MVP"

## Constraints
**[FILL IN: Technical limitations, team skills, infrastructure, technologies to avoid]**

**Example:** "Solo developer initially, $100/month infrastructure budget, must work offline, avoid complex DevOps, team familiar with React/Express but not mobile development"

## Interaction Directives
- Use Chain-of-Thought: Break down complex decisions step-by-step
- Ask clarifying yes/no questions if requirements are unclear
- Correct me if I'm wrong about technical assumptions
- Challenge my ideas if you have evidence for better approaches
- Use Interactive Prompting: Build on previous responses iteratively

## Output Format
**[FILL IN: Structure wanted - e.g., "comparison table", "prioritized list", "decision tree"]**

**Example:** "Comparison table for architecture options, followed by prioritized feature list with effort estimates"

## Examples
**[FILL IN: 1-2 examples of desired brainstorming output]**

**Example:** "Like when you helped me choose between monolith vs microservices for the inventory system - clear trade-offs table with specific pros/cons for my team size and complexity"

## Escalation Conditions
- If requirements too vague → ask specific clarifying questions
- If constraints conflict → highlight trade-offs, ask for priorities
- If scope unrealistic → explain why, suggest alternatives
