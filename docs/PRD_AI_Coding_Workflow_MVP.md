## Executive Summary

Building upon our existing prompt generation and Parsinator tools, we're expanding into a comprehensive AI coding workflow management platform. Our MVP will transform the current template-based prompt system into an intelligent, context-aware platform that solves the critical pain points identified in our user research: 87% of developers experience context switching friction and 74% struggle with prompt organization.

**Current State:** We have a functional web application with:
- FastAPI backend serving prompt generation and Parsinator functionality
- HTMX-powered frontend with tabbed interface
- Template-based prompt system with 10+ prompt templates
- Project brief processing capabilities (Parsinator)
- Basic web UI for both features

**MVP Vision:** Evolve this foundation into a unified AI coding workflow platform that preserves context across AI sessions, intelligently manages prompts, and integrates seamlessly with Claude Code and Cursor.
