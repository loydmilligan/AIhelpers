## Example Entry

### Manifest Update v1.1 - 2025-07-04

#### Trigger
Completion of Phase 2: Core MQTT Functionality (Tasks 2.1-2.2) with significant architectural discoveries during implementation.

#### Key Changes
- **Enhanced MQTTClient Architecture**: Updated to reflect EventEmitter inheritance with event-driven communication pattern
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Added exponential backoff reconnection logic with comprehensive error handling and recovery
- **MQTT Wildcard Support**: Implemented + and # wildcard topic matching for flexible subscription patterns
- **Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure**: Added complete test suite with real broker connectivity validation
- **Updated API Signatures**: Enhanced method signatures with better type support and JSON serialization

#### Reason for Changes
During implementation of Tasks 2.1-2.2, several architectural improvements emerged that significantly enhance the robustness and functionality of the MQTT client beyond the original planned scope:

1. **EventEmitter Pattern**: Discovered that async communication patterns work much better with event-driven architecture
2. **Enhanced Error Handling**: Real-world testing revealed need for sophisticated reconnection logic and error recovery
3. **Wildcard Support**: Implementation showed importance of flexible topic subscription patterns
4. **Testing Validation**: Need for comprehensive testing against real brokers became apparent for production readiness

#### Implementation Discoveries
- **EventEmitter Integration**: Event-driven patterns provide much cleaner async communication than callback-only approaches
- **Real-world Testing**: Live broker testing revealed edge cases not apparent in planning phase
- **Error Recovery**: Network reliability requires sophisticated reconnection strategies with exponential backoff
- **API Design**: Object-based parameters are more maintainable than multiple primitive parameters

#### Impact Assessment
- **Existing Tasks**: No breaking changes to planned tasks; all future tasks benefit from enhanced MQTT client
- **Architecture**: Stronger foundation with event-driven patterns and robust error handling
- **Dependencies**: No new external dependencies; enhanced use of existing libraries
- **Timeline**: No impact on timeline; enhancements were implemented within original task scope

#### Quality Improvements
- **Robustness**: Enhanced error handling and reconnection logic
- **Maintainability**: Event-driven architecture with clear separation of concerns
- **Testability**: Comprehensive test coverage with real-world scenario validation
- **Flexibility**: Wildcard support enables more sophisticated subscription patterns

#### Lessons Learned
- **EventEmitter Integration**: Event-driven patterns provide much cleaner async communication than callback-only approaches
- **Real-world Testing**: Live testing revealed edge cases not apparent in planning phase
- **Error Recovery**: Network reliability requires sophisticated reconnection strategies with exponential backoff
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Automated test suites with real connectivity are essential for production readiness
- **API Design**: Object-based parameters are more maintainable than multiple primitive parameters
