# Manifest Evolution Log

This document tracks changes to the proposed final manifest as the AI Coding Workflow Management Platform evolves through manifest-driven development.

## Initial Version - January 11, 2025

### Source
Created during project retrofit for manifest-driven development from existing codebase analysis and comprehensive task planning based on user research and PRD requirements.

### Current State Analysis
- **Existing codebase analyzed:** 19 source files documented in codebase_manifest.json
- **Foundation established:** FastAPI backend, HTMX frontend, Parsinator CLI system
- **AI integration active:** Google Gemini for prompt generation
- **Core functionality:** Template-based prompt system with 10+ templates
- **Project brief processing:** Complete Parsinator system with dependency analysis
- **Web interface:** Modern HTMX-powered frontend with responsive design
- **Development readiness:** 75% complete MVP implementation

### Task List Overview
- **Total tasks identified:** 20 major tasks across 4 development phases
- **Subtasks planned:** 75 detailed subtasks for systematic implementation
- **Timeline:** 12-week development schedule
- **Priority distribution:** 6 critical, 8 high, 4 medium, 2 low priority tasks

### Target Architecture Vision

#### Core Platform Components
1. **Intelligent Prompt Library** - Semantic search, versioning, analytics
2. **Session Context Preservation** - AI session continuity across tools
3. **Claude Code + Cursor Integration** - Seamless AI tool workflow
4. **Team Collaboration** - Shared prompts and workflows
5. **Enhanced Parsinator** - AI-powered project brief processing
6. **Progressive Web App** - Offline-capable, mobile-friendly interface
7. **Analytics Dashboard** - Usage insights and optimization recommendations

#### Technical Stack Evolution
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with Redis caching (upgrade from current file-based)
- **Authentication:** OAuth2 with JWT tokens (new capability)
- **Real-time features:** WebSocket integration (new capability)
- **AI integrations:** Multi-provider support (Gemini, Claude, OpenAI)
- **Frontend:** Enhanced HTMX with PWA capabilities
- **Deployment:** Production-ready containerization with CI/CD

#### Business Model Implementation
- **Freemium subscription tiers:** Free, Professional ($60/month), Team ($120/month)
- **Target metrics:** $25K MRR by Month 6, 1,000 users in 3 months
- **User personas:** Professional Millennials (29-44), Gen Z Early Adopters (18-28)
- **Pain point solutions:** 87% context switching friction, 74% prompt organization struggles

### Development Approach
- **Methodology:** Manifest-driven development retrofitted to existing codebase
- **Task execution:** Sequential task completion with manifest validation
- **Quality assurance:** Comprehensive testing, security scanning, performance monitoring
- **Deployment strategy:** Blue-green deployment with feature flags

### Phase Breakdown

#### Phase 1: Foundation & Core Features (Weeks 1-4)
- Database schema and models setup
- User authentication and authorization
- Enhanced prompt library backend
- Context preservation engine

#### Phase 2: Advanced Features & Integration (Weeks 5-8)
- Claude Code and Cursor integration
- Team collaboration features
- Basic analytics dashboard
- Enhanced Parsinator with AI

#### Phase 3: User Experience & Polish (Weeks 9-10)
- Progressive Web App implementation
- Mobile-responsive design
- Performance optimization
- Advanced search and filtering

#### Phase 4: Launch Preparation (Weeks 11-12)
- Security audit and compliance
- Production deployment setup
- Documentation completion
- User onboarding optimization

### Success Criteria Mapping
- **Technical:** All 20 tasks completed with acceptance criteria met
- **Business:** Revenue targets, user acquisition, retention rates achieved
- **Quality:** Security audit passed, performance benchmarks met
- **User Experience:** 70% feature adoption, 60% efficiency gains

### Risk Mitigation
- **Technical debt:** Systematic refactoring during enhancement
- **Integration complexity:** Phased AI tool integration approach
- **User adoption:** Continuous user feedback integration
- **Performance:** Proactive optimization and monitoring

### Future Updates
Updates will be logged here as tasks are completed and architectural insights are gained during the development process.
