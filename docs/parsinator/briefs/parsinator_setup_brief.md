# Project Setup Brief: Parsinator

## Project Name
Parsinator - Parse project briefs to create detailed task lists for personal coding projects

## Problem Statement
Developers need a systematic way to convert high-level project ideas into actionable, dependency-aware task lists without manual planning overhead. Current approach requires lengthy manual task breakdown and dependency mapping.

## Setup Scope
Establish the foundational Python CLI structure that can read brief files, generate tasks, and integrate with existing AIhelpers workflow.

## Core Setup Tasks
### Must-Have Infrastructure
1. **Python CLI Project Structure**: Create src/parsinator/ directory with main.py entry point, utils module, and proper package structure following AIhelpers conventions.
2. **File I/O Framework**: Set up robust file reading/writing capabilities for handling .md brief files and .json task files with proper error handling.
3. **Command Structure**: Implement basic CLI commands using Click/Typer for processing individual briefs and batch processing multiple brief files.
4. **Brief Template Integration**: Create system to locate and validate brief template files, ensuring they follow the required format structure.
5. **Task Generation Foundation**: Set up core data structures and classes for representing tasks, dependencies, and project metadata.

### Optional Setup Tasks
1. **Configuration Management**: Add config file support for default settings and user preferences.
2. **Logging System**: Implement structured logging for debugging and monitoring the parsing process.

## Technical Requirements
- **Language**: Python 3.8+
- **Framework**: CLI tool using Click or Typer
- **Dependencies**: Click/Typer for CLI, PyYAML for config, pathlib for file handling
- **Environment**: Must integrate with existing AIhelpers project structure
- **File Formats**: Input .md files, output .json and .txt files

## Success Criteria
- Developer can run `parsinator --help` and see available commands
- System can read and validate brief template files without errors
- Basic CLI framework supports future feature additions
- File I/O handles missing files and permission errors gracefully
- Integration point established for AI prompt generation

## Constraints
- **Compatibility**: Must work alongside existing AIhelpers CLI structure
- **Dependencies**: Minimize external dependencies to keep installation simple
- **Standards**: Follow same code style and structure as main AIhelpers project

## Dependencies from Other Briefs
- **None** (This is the first brief to run)

## Enables Future Briefs
- **Feature Parsing**: Requires CLI structure and file I/O capabilities
- **Deployment**: Needs basic project structure for testing and documentation
